    \"The pottery's city\". 
    Since i was a child i started to increase my natural artistic talent poiting 
    that talent to the art of pottery, 
    in particoular creating abstract and animal sculptures.
    Thanks to the teaching of good masters i became a good pottery worker so i 
    started working for a relevant pottery agency in my village.
    Since i was 15, photography was for me a passion and, despite the inconsciency of
    these year i tried to take, in each moment, the most lived and artistic aspect of that moment.
