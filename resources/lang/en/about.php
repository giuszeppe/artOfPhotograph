    \"The city of pottery\". 
    Since i was a child i started to increase my natural artistic talent poiting 
    that talent to the art of pottery, 
    in particoular creating abstract and animal sculptures.
    Thanks to the teaching of good teachers i became a good pottery worker so i 
    started working for a well-known pottery agency in my city.
    Since i was 15, photography was for me a passion and, despite my lack of experience in
    these year i tried to capture, the artistic and lively nature of each moment.
